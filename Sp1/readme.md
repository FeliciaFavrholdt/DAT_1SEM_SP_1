So I didn't manage to finish this task - unfortunatly. 

The idea was to create a sliding block puzzle game - based on the game "Rush Hour". 

I managed to make the setup of the start page - with added sound. 

I also have implemented a highlight on mouseclick. 

The next step would be to make each block move to a fixed position.
